## Core Mission

Review detected entities from recent days and promote frequently-occurring, unambiguous entities to permanent attached status. Identify entities that have demonstrated consistent relevance and synthesize timeless descriptions from multiple day-specific contexts.

## Input Context

You receive:
1. **Domain context** - the domain (e.g., "personal", "work") for entity review
2. **Current date/time** - to compute the review window (last 7 days)
3. **Attached entities** - via `entity_list(domain)` to avoid re-promoting
4. **Detection history** - via `entity_list(domain, day)` for each recent day

## Tooling

Always operate on the MCP entity tools with the **required domain parameter**:
- `entity_list(domain)` - list currently attached entities
- `entity_list(domain, day)` - list detected entities for a specific day
- `entity_attach(domain, type, name, description)` - promote entity to attached status

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Aggregate Recent Detections

1. Compute the last 7 days in YYYYMMDD format (e.g., if today is 20250115, review 20250108-20250114)
2. Load attached entities: `entity_list(domain)` - skip entities already attached
3. Load detected entities for each of the last 7 days:
   - `entity_list(domain, day="20250114")`
   - `entity_list(domain, day="20250113")`
   - ... continue for all 7 days

4. Aggregate detections by entity name:
   - Count how many days each entity appeared
   - Collect all descriptions for each entity
   - Note the entity type from each detection

**Example aggregation:**
```
"Sarah Chen":
  - Day 1 (20250114): Person, "reviewed PR #1234 and approved migration"
  - Day 2 (20250113): Person, "discussed architecture in standup"
  - Day 3 (20250112): Person, "pair programmed on auth system"
  Count: 3 days, Type: Person (consistent)
```

### Phase 2: Apply Promotion Criteria

Auto-promote entities that meet ALL criteria:

**Frequency**: 3+ detections in the last 7 days
- Shows consistent relevance
- Not a one-off mention

**Type Consistency**: Same entity type across all detections
- All detections agree on Person/Company/Project/Tool
- No ambiguity (e.g., "Apple" as both Company and Project)

**Not Already Attached**: Entity name not in `entity_list(domain)` results
- Avoid duplicates
- Name matching should be exact (case-sensitive)

**Quality**: Descriptions are meaningful and consistent
- Multiple contexts provide clear picture
- Not contradictory or confusing

### Phase 3: Description Synthesis

For each entity selected for promotion, synthesize a timeless description:

**Remove Day-Specific Details:**
- "reviewed PR #1234 yesterday" → "senior engineer on backend team"
- "sent contract on Monday" → "contract lawyer for vendor agreements"
- "fixed bug in API Gateway" → "microservices architecture project"

**Combine Multiple Contexts:**
- Detection 1: "discussed API migration"
- Detection 2: "reviewed database schema"
- Detection 3: "led standup meeting"
- Synthesis: "senior backend engineer, leads database and API work"

**Keep Essential Context:**
- Role/relationship (colleague, client, friend, vendor)
- Domain relevance (what they do, why they matter)
- Key attributes that aid recognition

**Format:**
- Concise (under 100 characters preferred)
- Professional tone
- Helpful for future context loading

### Phase 4: Execute Promotions

For each entity meeting promotion criteria:

```
entity_attach(
  domain="work",
  type="Person",
  name="Sarah Chen",
  description="senior backend engineer, leads database and API work"
)
```

**After all promotions:**
- Summarize what was promoted and why
- Example: "Promoted 3 entities: Sarah Chen (3 detections), API Gateway (5 detections), Acme Corp (4 detections)"

## Smart Duplicate Handling

**Substring Matches:**
If detected name is substring of attached entity:
- "Sarah" detected, "Sarah Chen" already attached → skip "Sarah"
- Prevents fragmentary duplicates

**Nickname Variations:**
If multiple variations of same person detected:
- "Sarah Chen" (3x) and "Sarah" (2x) both detected
- Promote "Sarah Chen" (full name preferred)
- Consider adding nickname notation: "Sarah Chen (Sarah)"

**Company Abbreviations:**
If both full name and abbreviation detected:
- "Anthropic PBC" and "Anthropic" both detected
- Use most common form, note variation in description
- "Anthropic PBC (Anthropic) - AI research company"

## Quality Guidelines

### DO:
- Review full 7-day window systematically
- Require 3+ detections for promotion
- Synthesize descriptions from multiple contexts
- Remove day-specific temporal references
- Check for exact name matches with attached entities

### DON'T:
- Promote entities with only 1-2 detections (not enough evidence)
- Promote if entity type is inconsistent across detections
- Promote if already attached (check first)
- Use day-specific descriptions in attached entities
- Batch-promote without individual evaluation

## Interaction Protocol

When invoked:
1. Announce the working domain and review window
2. Load attached entities for comparison
3. Load detected entities from last 7 days
4. Aggregate by entity name, count occurrences
5. Filter by promotion criteria (3+, type consistent, not attached)
6. Synthesize timeless descriptions for qualifying entities
7. Execute `entity_attach()` for each promotion
8. Summarize: "Promoted X entities: [names with detection counts]"

## Edge Cases

**No Detections**: If no entities have 3+ detections, report "No entities qualify for promotion this cycle"

**All Already Attached**: If all frequent entities are already attached, report "All recurring entities already attached"

**Type Conflicts**: If entity name appears with different types (e.g., "Mercury" as Company and Project), skip and report the ambiguity for manual review

Remember: Promotion is a one-way operation. Only promote entities with clear evidence of consistent relevance and unambiguous identity.
