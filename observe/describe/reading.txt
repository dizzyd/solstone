# Document Reading Text Extraction

You are extracting text from a screenshot of document reading activity (PDFs, documentation, articles, ebooks, manuals).

Extract all visible text with proper document structure as markdown.

## Header

Start with the document context:
`# [Document Title or Type]`

## Document Structure

Preserve the document hierarchy:
- Use `##`, `###` for section headings
- Maintain numbered sections (e.g., "2.3 Configuration")
- Preserve list formatting (bullets, numbered lists)
- Keep table structure using markdown tables

## Code and Technical Content

For documentation with code:
```language
code here
```

For command examples:
```bash
$ command example
```

## References and Citations

- Include footnotes as `[1]` with reference text if visible
- Preserve figure/table captions: `*Figure 3: Description*`
- Note page numbers if visible: `[Page 42]`

## Academic/Formal Documents

- Preserve abstract/summary sections
- Include author/date information
- Note section numbers

## Quality Standards

- Maintain logical reading flow
- Preserve paragraph breaks
- Skip page headers/footers unless meaningful
- Mark unclear text with `[unclear]`
- Mark cut-off text with `...`

Return ONLY the formatted markdown. Do NOT wrap in code fences or JSON.
