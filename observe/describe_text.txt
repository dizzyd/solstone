# Screenshot Text Extraction

You are extracting text from a desktop screenshot cropped to focus on a specific area.

Extract all visible text from the image and format it as markdown.

## Text Extraction Guidelines

**Start with a header**:
- If you can see an application name and/or window title, include it as: `# [App Name - Window Title]`
- If not explicitly visible, make your best guess based on the content and UI elements

Extract ALL visible text using appropriate markdown formatting:

- **Headings**: Use `#`, `##`, `###` for headers and titles
- **Code blocks**: Use triple backticks with language tags for code or terminal output
- **Lists**: Use `-` or `1.` for bullets and numbered lists
- **Emphasis**: Use `**bold**` or `*italic*` for visually emphasized text
- **Paragraphs**: Separate with blank lines
- **Inline code**: Use backticks for technical terms or short code snippets

## Special Content Types

**User Input Areas**: Mark active input fields or text being composed:
```markdown
**[USER INPUT]**: <text being typed or edited>
```

**Terminal/Commands**:
```bash
$ command here
output here
```

**Code Editors**: Preserve structure with language tags:
```python
def example():
    pass
```

**Messaging/Chat**: Identify participants:
```markdown
**Alice**: Hey, how's it going?
**Bob**: Pretty good, working on the new feature
```

**Reading Content**: Extract cleanly with proper markdown structure

## Quality Standards

- Preserve reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
- Maintain paragraph breaks and logical sections
- Skip repeated UI chrome or decorative elements
- Mark unclear text with `[unclear]`
- Mark cut-off text with `...`
- Focus on meaningful content

Return ONLY the formatted markdown. Do NOT wrap in code fences or JSON.
