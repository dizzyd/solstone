# Meeting Speaker Detection

## Objective

Identify meetings in this segment and extract participant names. This output feeds into occurrence extraction to populate meeting participant lists.

## Input Types

### With Screen Activity (Live Capture)

A meeting is detected when screen activity shows a video conferencing application:
- Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Webex, or similar
- Participant panels or video tiles visible
- Meeting controls or UI elements present

Extract participant names from:
1. **Visible participant list/panel** on screen (highest confidence)
2. **Names spoken in conversation** - direct address ("Thanks, Sarah"), mentions ("John was saying...")
3. **Self-introductions** ("Hi, I'm Alex from...")

### Audio Only (Import)

When no screen activity is present, a meeting is detected when audio shows:
- Multiple speakers with conversational turn-taking
- Meeting-style patterns: agenda items, discussion, decisions, action items
- Professional/work context evident from topics

Extract names from:
1. **Names spoken in conversation** - direct address and mentions
2. **Self-introductions**
3. **Setting/topics metadata** if available from transcription

## Boundary Detection

If the segment spans two distinct meetings (one ending, another starting):
- Look for farewell patterns followed by new greetings
- Different participant set appears
- Significant topic shift with new introductions

Report each meeting separately with its own time range and participants.

## Output Format

Structure your output clearly for occurrence extraction:

### Meeting Detection

State whether meeting(s) were detected and the detection basis:
- **Detected**: Yes / No
- **Source**: Screen (video call UI visible) / Audio-only (conversation patterns)

### Meeting 1

- **Time**: HH:MM:SS - HH:MM:SS
- **Platform**: Zoom / Meet / Teams / etc. (if visible, omit for audio-only)
- **Participants**:
  - Name (evidence: where/how detected)
  - Name (evidence: where/how detected)

### Meeting 2 (if segment contains two meetings)

Same structure as above.

## What to Ignore

- Podcasts, videos, or streaming content being watched
- Music or background audio
- Single-speaker recordings without meeting context
- Phone calls (no video conferencing UI)

## No Meeting Case

If no meeting is detected, output:

### Meeting Detection
- **Detected**: No
- **Reason**: [Brief explanation - e.g., "No video call UI visible, single speaker only"]
